Outside of that, I also really enjoy gothic and classical literature! With that being said, I hope you have a great time at AME!"

A few things I like to do in my free time is play gacha games (Genshin Impact, Arknights, and Konosuba Fantastic Days), build gunpla, and dabble in a little bit of Sumo Wrestling. A fun fact about me is that I fluent in both English and Spanish, while also learning Japanese. As for anime, some of my favorites include Tsurezure Children, Gurren Lagann, Konosuba, In/Spectre, Oregairu (Yui is best girl !), ReLife, Macross F, Gundam Series, and Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. I have no set genre of anime that I watch so I am open to anything you may want to recommend me. If you see me at GBM feel free to come up to me and talk about whatever. I hope you enjoy your time here at AME!!!"

As far as anime goes I like to watch pretty much anything and am always looking for suggestions if you have any. My favorites would probably be In/Spectre, JJK, Dororo, Rising of Shield Hero, and Kaguya-Sama. I also like to play lots of different kinds of games but I have been really into Apex if you ever need another person to play with. Besides those things I am a film buff, a runner, and someone who enjoys learning about different things, especially different cultures. I am also in the process of learning Japanese so if you ever wanna study together let me know, I could definitely use it. Hope you enjoy your time in the club and have fun finding a community for you!"
