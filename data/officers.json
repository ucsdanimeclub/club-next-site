That being said, some of my favorites are Blue Period, Mob Psycho 100, and The Case Study of Vanitas. I do also love a fair amount of video games, some of my favorites being The Witcher, Ace Attorney, Hollow Knight, Hades, along with Nintendo franchises and TTRPGs. Outside of that, I also really enjoy gothic and classical literature! With that being said, I hope you have a great time at AME!"

        "Hola, My name is Melvin and I'm a third year Human Biology Major at Muir. A few things I like to do in my free time is play gacha games (Genshin Impact, Arknights, and Konosuba Fantastic Days), build gunpla, and dabble in a little bit of Sumo Wrestling. A fun fact about me is that I fluent in both English and Spanish, while also learning Japanese. As for anime, some of my favorites include Tsurezure Children, Gurren Lagann, Konosuba, In/Spectre, Oregairu (Yui is best girl !), ReLife, Macross F, Gundam Series, and Ansatsu Kyoushitsu. I have no set genre of anime that I watch so I am open to anything you may want to recommend me. If you see me at GBM feel free to come up to me and talk about whatever. I hope you enjoy your time here at AME!!!"

I don't watch as much anime as the other people on the board, but I still have my favorites list (currently Kimi no Na wa/Tenki no Ko/Suzume no Tojimari, 86, A Silent Voice, and Bocchi the Rock). The thing I'm a bigger into is collecting anime vinyl records, whether it be OPs/EDs or full OSTs (and I'm always hyped to share my collection)! I also play my fair share of gacha games since.... I have nothing better to do... Currently on the list is Genshin Impact, Arknights, and Honkai Star Rail, so shoot me a message if you ever want to add me!"
