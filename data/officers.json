A few things I like to do in my free time is play gacha games (Genshin Impact, Arknights, and Konosuba Fantastic Days), build gunpla, and dabble in a little bit of Sumo Wrestling. A fun fact about me is that I fluent in both English and Spanish, while also learning Japanese.

I have nothing better to do... Currently on the list is Genshin Impact, Arknights, and Honkai Star Rail, so shoot me a message if you ever want to add me!"

My favorites would probably be In/Spectre, JJK, Dororo, Rising of Shield Hero, and Kaguya-Sama. I also like to play lots of different kinds of games but I have been really into Apex if you ever need another person to play with. Besides those things I am a film buff, a runner, and someone who enjoys learning about different things, especially different cultures. I am also in the process of learning Japanese so if you ever wanna study together let me know, I could definitely use it. Hope you enjoy your time in the club and have fun finding a community for you!"
